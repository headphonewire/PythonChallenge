Python-challenge
This project analyzed financial records of a company called PyBank.

PyBank
The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

- This is the result after running the script.

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change : $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

PyPoll
Vote-Counting

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

- This is the result after running a script.

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes :  369711

Charles Casper Stockham : 23.0500% (85213)
Diana DeGette : 73.8100% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane : 3.1400% (11606)
